# serverless-state-machine-cqrs

CQRS and event-sourced agreement settlement workflow built with AWS SAM, Lambda, API Gateway, PostgreSQL, Supabase Auth, and a Vite UI.

> **Upstream reference:** [serverless-state-machine](https://github.com/icetique/serverless-state-machine) — CRUD + transactional outbox + deployed demo.  
> **This repo:** experimental rewrite toward event-sourced writes, read-model projections, and explicit command/query separation.

## What it does

- Creates agreements between a merchant and a partner
- Enforces the state machine: `CREATED -> APPROVED -> FUNDED -> SETTLED`
- Persists audit history in `agreement_events`
- Persists settlement bookings in `ledger_entries`
- Persists domain events to `outbox_events` and dispatches them asynchronously
- Settles funded agreements via **EventBridge → SQS → Lambda** (not synchronous HTTP)
- Uses idempotency keys to make command retries safe
- Shares JWT auth and RBAC helpers through a dedicated Lambda layer
- Exposes a local UI for workflow execution, Supabase-backed sign-in, events, and ledger visibility
- Includes a `SettlementProcessorFunction` that consumes settlement work from SQS-shaped input

**Boundaries worth knowing:**

- **`shared/`** holds `AuthContext` and JWT wire types for the UI. Lambdas cannot import it at runtime; they use **`layers/lambda-utils`** instead (same domain types, duplicated on purpose for packaging).
- **`tests/fixtures/http-api/`** is for Lambda unit tests (mock API Gateway events). **`apps/ui/src/test-support/`** is for React/Vitest fixtures — different jobs, different folders.
- Root **`npm test`** / **`npm run typecheck`** orchestrate all packages via `cd` chains; there is no npm workspaces setup (each package has its own `package-lock.json`).

## Scope and intentional tradeoffs

This repo is a **working demo** of agreement workflow, outbox delivery, and async settlement — not a production product template. A few items are deliberately left as-is:

| Area                 | Choice                                                   | Why                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **CI**               | No GitHub Actions                                        | Quality gate is manual: `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run validate:template`, `sam build` before demo or deploy. |
| **Monorepo tooling** | No npm workspaces                                        | Keeps SAM `CodeUri` paths and per-Lambda packages straightforward; root scripts chain `cd` into each package.            |
| **IaC routing**      | OpenAPI `DefinitionBody` plus explicit `Events: HttpApi` | SAM bug workaround so JWT authorizer routes deploy correctly — see comment block in `template.yaml`.                     |
| **Outbox dispatch**  | At-least-once to EventBridge                             | Publish and `markPublished` cannot share a Postgres transaction with `PutEvents`; settlement is idempotent downstream.   |
| **Auth types**       | `shared/` (UI) vs `layers/lambda-utils` (Lambda)         | Same domain `AuthContext`, duplicated because the layer cannot import UI compile-time packages at runtime.               |
| **UI polish**        | Global CSS; limited a11y                                 | Cohesive demo UI; not targeting WCAG compliance or design-system scoping.                                                |

If you are reviewing for production hardening, the highest-value next steps would be CI, workspace tooling, and accessibility — none of which block the current workflow demo.

## Async settlement (SQS)

After `POST /agreements/{id}/fund`, settlement is **not** done in the HTTP response. The default path is async:

```text
create / approve / fund (HTTP Lambda)
        │
        ▼
  outbox_events + agreement row          (same Postgres transaction)
        │
        ▼
  OutboxDispatcherFunction                 (scheduled; publishes pending rows)
        │
        ▼
  EventBridge  (AgreementFunded)
        │
        ▼
  settlement-queue (SQS, name: `{StackName}-settlement-queue`)   (DLQ: `{StackName}-settlement-dlq` after 3 receives)
        │
        ▼
  SettlementProcessorFunction            (SQS trigger; FUNDED → SETTLED + ledger)
```

Infrastructure is defined in `template.yaml`: `SettlementQueue`, `FundedEventRule`, `SettlementProcessorFunction`, and `OutboxDispatcherFunction`.

- **Deployed:** fund returns once the agreement is `FUNDED`; the UI polls until `SETTLED` (~outbox dispatch interval + SQS/Lambda latency).
- **Local API (`sam local start-api`):** HTTP workflow works, but SQS is not wired automatically — use `sam local invoke OutboxDispatcherFunction` and `SettlementProcessorFunction` (or `npm run smoke:async-retry`) to exercise the async path.
- **Manual settle:** `POST /agreements/{id}/settle` exists but is off by default (`ENABLE_MANUAL_SETTLEMENT_TRIGGER=false`).

See [Settlement execution modes](#settlement-execution-modes) for invoke commands and the retry smoke script.

Queue names are scoped to the CloudFormation stack (`{StackName}-settlement-queue` / `{StackName}-settlement-dlq`). If you previously deployed with global queue names, see [docs/aws-settlement-queue-migration.md](docs/aws-settlement-queue-migration.md).

## Local setup

Prerequisites:

- Docker
- Node.js
- SAM CLI

Run migrations (loads `DATABASE_URL` from `.env` automatically):

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # first time only
npm run migrate:up
```

Start the local API:

```bash
cp samconfig.example.toml samconfig.toml
# edit samconfig.toml and replace DatabaseUrl before continuing
sam build
sam local start-api --env-vars .env.json --skip-pull-image --disable-authorizer
```

`--disable-authorizer` is required because SAM local does not support API Gateway HTTP API JWT
authorizers. The deployed API validates JWTs at the edge via `SupabaseJwtAuthorizer` in the OpenAPI
`DefinitionBody`; locally, the shared `lambda-utils` layer parses the `Authorization: Bearer`
header instead when `AWS_SAM_LOCAL` is set (SAM sets this automatically). Sign in through the UI as
usual — auth still works, it just happens inside Lambda rather than at API Gateway.

`samconfig.toml` is intentionally local-only. The repo ships `samconfig.example.toml` as the template for deploy and local SAM settings.

Start the UI:

```bash
cd apps/ui
npm run dev
```

For local UI, leave `VITE_API_BASE_URL` unset in `apps/ui/.env` (the app uses `/api`; Vite proxies that
to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`). Do not point the browser directly at SAM — cross-origin CORS preflight
fails with the OpenAPI `DefinitionBody` template. Restart `npm run dev` after changing `vite.config.ts`.

## Auth

See **[docs/supabase-setup.md](docs/supabase-setup.md)** for creating demo users, `raw_app_meta_data`, the `custom_access_token_hook` SQL, and JWT verification.

- The frontend signs in with Supabase Auth and sends `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
- **Deployed:** API Gateway HTTP API validates the JWT before invoking Lambda (`SupabaseJwtAuthorizer`)
- **Local (`sam local start-api`):** use `--disable-authorizer`; Lambdas parse the bearer token in the
  shared layer when `AWS_SAM_LOCAL` is set (signature verification is skipped locally — acceptable
  for dev because you control the token source via Supabase sign-in)
- Lambdas map trusted claims into `AuthContext`
- The HTTP-facing Lambdas consume a shared `lambda-utils` layer instead of duplicating JWT parsing logic per function
- Required claims:
    - `sub`
    - `app_role`
- Conditional claims:
    - `merchant_id`
    - `partner_id`

The local UI uses the same Supabase-backed login flow as the deployed app. Configure:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` — **production only** (API Gateway URL on Vercel); omit locally
- `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` / `.env.json`

## Local database

Local development uses a Supabase Postgres `DATABASE_URL`.

## Settlement execution modes

Commands and fixtures for the [async SQS path](#async-settlement-sqs) above:

- Manual `POST /agreements/{id}/settle` is disabled by default (local and deployed). Settlement runs via outbox → EventBridge → SQS → `SettlementProcessorFunction`. Set `ENABLE_MANUAL_SETTLEMENT_TRIGGER=true` only if you need a synchronous settle shortcut for debugging.
- `SettlementProcessor` and `SettlementProcessorFunction` execute the settlement path used by the `EventBridge -> SQS -> Lambda` flow
- Domain events are written to `outbox_events` inside the same database transaction and dispatched asynchronously by `OutboxDispatcherFunction`
- A local SQS-shaped fixture is available at `events/settlement-sqs-event.json`

Invoke the async-ready settlement handler locally:

```bash
sam local invoke SettlementProcessorFunction --env-vars .env.json --event events/settlement-sqs-event.json
```

Dispatch pending outbox events locally:

```bash
sam local invoke OutboxDispatcherFunction --env-vars .env.json
```

Run the async retry smoke script with Supabase credentials:

```bash
SUPABASE_URL=...
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
MERCHANT_PASSWORD=...
PARTNER_PASSWORD=...
ADMIN_PASSWORD=...
node scripts/smoke-async-retry.mjs
```

## Testing

Run all Lambda tests (compile + unit) from the project root:

```bash
npm test
```

Run all tests with coverage (Lambda packages + UI):

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

UI unit tests (Vitest + Testing Library):

```bash
cd apps/ui && npm test
cd apps/ui && npm run test:coverage
cd apps/ui && npm run typecheck:test
```

Optional browser smoke (requires local SAM + Vite + Supabase demo users — see [docs/supabase-setup.md](docs/supabase-setup.md)):

```bash
# Terminal 1: sam local start-api …
# Terminal 2: cd apps/ui && npm run dev
cd apps/ui && npm run test:e2e
```

Per-package tests (also available from the root):

```bash
cd functions/create-agreement && npm test
cd functions/transition-agreement && npm test
cd functions/list-agreements && npm test
cd functions/debug-events && npm test
cd functions/list-ledger && npm test
```

UI build:

```bash
cd apps/ui && npm run build
```
